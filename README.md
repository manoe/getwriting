# **_getwriting_**: A Minimal Latex Template for Journal Articles
__Clean, beautiful Latex template for writing journal articles__

NEW: This template is now available on the Overleaf Gallery at https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/getwriting-a-minimal-latex-template-for-journal-articles/vjvgghbjvzqf

This LaTex template provides a moderate extension to the base article class by pre-loading the usual formatting packages with options that make the finished product far easier to read. 

I believe it's a useful template for bioR&chi;iv, medR&chi;iv, and format-free submissions.

**This template is provided as-is.** I don't claim that it is either the most functional or the most flexible - it is, however, designed to get your writing process up and running ASAP, while still generating a reader-friendly document. The template also functions as a quickstart guide to LaTex for beginners - again, there are many tutorials out there and this is just what I think will get you writing quickly and efficiently.

**Note on the font used in this template:** 

This document uses the beautiful and free Atkinson Hyperlegible font, which is designed for low-vision readers. The TrueType font files are included with this template and you can download the font from the Braille Institute here: https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont

Further documentation is in the PDF file: https://github.com/mgp13/Minimal-Template-for-Journal-Articles/blob/main/getwriting.pdf
